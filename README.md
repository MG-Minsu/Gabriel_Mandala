BSCS 1-A Mandala Art (Midterm Activitt)

Mathew Gabriel

In making the mandala art, I wanted to incorporate the flow of how it is made. To begin with, the Python turtle draws different colors with the mathematical equation in a dynamic format. It focuses on different backgrounds and colors of the mandala. First, the first spirograph is set as a basic layer having a white background. Second, I give it a dynamic flow by setting the background color to black. Following with the additional design of the second and third spirograph. The go-to design is inspired by a printed type art design, that is why I added some texture to the art by having spirograph art and turning the background to red to give it a texture. The technique used in making is setting the turtle through different functions such as penup(), pendown(), and goto(). These functions helped to navigate the turtle to organize its design.
